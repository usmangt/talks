# 3 data source plugins - Grafana & Friends Meetup Frankfurt

In this repo, you will find information about the useful links that I presented during my talk on **3 data source plugins** to add in your Grafana stack.

This talk was presented at **[GrafanaCON 2025](https://grafana.com/events/grafanacon/)** in Seattle, US.

In case any of the links do not work, then please report an issue about it and I will be happy to fix it ASAP.
