In this repo, you will find information about the useful links that I presented during my talk on **Observe your GitHub data Efficiently using Grafana**.

This talk was presented at a Meetup for **[Women in Software Engineering (WiSE) Japan](https://www.civo.com/navigate/north-america)** in Tokyo, Japan ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ

In case any of the links do not work, then please report an issue about it and I will be happy to fix it ASAP.
